# Korean Learning App

This is a personal project for me to practice Angular and also at the same time build a page that I can use to improve my Korean. This page is deployed using firebase and you can visit it in this [link](https://lets-learn-korean.web.app/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
